## About

This repo was a prototype attempt to explore a patient's system and experience using the Internal Family Systems modality. Based on a list of tasks which we configured in a supabase database, the software would conditionally advance the script in order to aid the user in this process.

Neither myself, nor my project stakeholders at the time, were satisfied with the end result. I also wasn't particularly happy with the nonexistent marginal returns we would get on fine tuning the OpenAI prompts. Not to mention the API architecture at the time was pre function calling, so actually translating chat completions into function executions was inconsistent and hard to work with. As a result this particular project was abandoned. It's public now simply to showcase work done.
